1) Nothing new for me except a generated SSH code
2) I was 'surprised' about 3 and 4 weeks of  Introduction to Git and GitHub course.
Since I was advice by the Course to pay 39$ for these last 2 weeks.
However, the learngitbranching.js.org tasks were cool and CS50 great lesson which helps me to improve my English/
3) Defenitely, I will use the Git since it will be the part of my job.
